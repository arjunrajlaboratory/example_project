This data is WM989 RNA-seq from Shaffer, et al. 2017. This file was copied over from the dropbox for this paper, here:

This table was generated using the RajLabSeqTools pipeline from bitbucket:
https://bitbucket.org/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabseqtools

The meta data files contain important experimental parameters. Here some of the important parameters are whether the cells are treated with drug, clone numbers, resistance status, etc. We also deposited this data into GEO, so we included some of the file names needed for the GEO deposit in this table as well. 

The annotation files have useful information for hg19 (which is the version of the genome that this data was aligned to), including a table for gene lengths (to normalize the data appropriately) and a table with ENSG IDs and gene names (because the output table from RajLabSeqTools only has ENSG IDs).
