Here are two CSV files containing count data from two different types of RNA FISH experiments. The first data set is spot counts from a stack images taken at incrementally increasing positions in z. The data here is the same as the worked example on the Raj Lab bitbucket. 
Here is the link to the example:
https://bitbucket.org/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki/workedExample


The second data set is from a Raj Lab image tool called “dentist”. This software takes single plane tiled images and performs spot counting on the cells. 
Example usage here:
https://bitbucket.org/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki/Dentist


Software for both of these data types are in the rajlabimagetools repo here:
